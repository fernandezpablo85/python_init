""" You are going to be given an array of integers. 
Your job is to take that array and find an index N where 
the sum of the integers to the left of N is equal to 
the sum of the integers to the right of N. 
If there is no index that would make this happen, return -1.
Example:
Array {1,2,3,4,3,2,1} return 3 
(at the 3rd position of the array, the sum of left side 
of the index ({1,2,3}) and the sum of the right side 
of the index ({3,2,1}) both equal 6
